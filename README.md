# 🕯️ The Altar App  

> _“The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.”_

## **Introduction**

Many believers use devotionals to learn God’s Word and reflect on how it applies to their lives. Devotionals can be helpful, but there are moments when we long for something more personal — a word that speaks directly to the situation we’re in.

The **Altar App** is built around a simple idea:  
You flip to a random chapter in Scripture and **trust** that wherever you land, the Holy Spirit intends to speak to you there. Then, you bring both your **situation** and the **chapter** you’ve flipped to before the Lord.

The app’s **Scripture Assistant** will:

- Help you find **parallels** between your current situation and the chapter you’ve landed on.
- Create a **custom devotional**, anchored in God’s Word.
- Encourage you to listen prayerfully for how the Lord might be guiding you.

This app is not meant to replace time in prayer or Scripture but to invite you to **bring your heart to the altar** and seek God’s leading.
